# petitio

A zero-dependency HTTP library designed to be simple, fast, and type-strong.

Credit to [Centra] for inspiration, as Petitio was originally a fork.

## What's with the name?

*"Petitio"* is a hybrid between the French word for "small" ("petit"), and the
Latin word for "request" ("petitio"). This library was originally called
`@helperdiscord/centra`, but we changed it to evolve beyond our status as a
Centra fork and set out to create the smallest and fastest high-level Node HTTP
wrapper available.
